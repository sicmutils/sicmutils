;; ## Generic Numerics
;;
;; The first section introduces generic versions of
;; Clojure's [[+]], [[-]], [[*]] and [[/]] operations. Any type that can
;; implement all four of these operations forms a
;; mathematical [Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)).
;;
;; There are, of course, other technical names for types that can only implement
;; a subset of these operations, and more specializations of those names
;; depending on whether or not the implementation of these binary operations is
;; commutative or
;; associative. (See [Semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup)
;; and [Monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) first, and start exploring
;; the realm of abstract algebra from there.)
;;
;; This library takes a permissive stance on extensibility. Types extend the
;; arithmetic operators by extending their unary or binary cases:
;;
;; - [[add]] for [[+]]
;; - [[sub]] and [[negate]] for [[-]]
;; - [[mul]] for [[*]]
;; - [[invert]] and [[div]] for [[/]]
;;
;; And the higher arity version reduces its list of arguments using this binary
;; operation. This makes it possible and easy to make the arithmetic operators
;; combine different types! It's up to you to do this in a mathematically
;; responsible way.
;;
;; Dispatch occurs via [[value/argument-kind]]. Documentation on how to extend
;; each generic operation to some new type is sparse. Have a look
;; at [[sicmutils.complex]] for an example of how to do this.
